Hello, my (nick)name's minusUnity!
I'm a Czech developer, interested in programming for games, websites and some mods for minecraft.
What mods? OpenComputers for 1.12.2! It's programming language is LUA, simple but little bit different of other programming languages.
I am ready to publish some of my games and stuff for my LUA programs, but some of them will be private.

Wish you a nice day!
